    <p id="His1" class="His1">I was born in April 1994 in the Argentine province of Mendoza.
         <br>I have a large family between brothers and nephews, which I love very much.
         <br>My city is known as the cradle of good wine;
         <br>we have varied landscapes and our greatest strength is tourism.</p>

    <p id="Lov" class="Lov">What I love the most in my life is the small family that I have formed with my two children and my partner.
        <br> I really like animals, especially dogs, their loyalty and companionship is unique.</p>

    <p id="His2" class="His2">My partner and father of my children are programmed with systems and I was always curious about the subject,
        <br> but I was never encouraged, until I found Khan Academy and fell in love with his beautiful way of educating.
        <br> And from now on I want to continue internalizing myself in the world of programming </p>
